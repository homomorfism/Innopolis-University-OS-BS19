#### Task 1

Which of the following is **NOT** a general I/O approach?

Select one:
- ```Software-based I/O ``` <- **Correct, obviously**
- ```Programmed I/O```
- ```Interrupt-driven I/O```
- ```I/O using DMA```

#### Task 2 

In which of the following four I/O software layers is computing the ```track, sector and head for a disk read performed```?

Select one:
- ```User-level software```
- ```Device driver ``` <- **Correct**
- ```Device-independent software```
- ```Interrupt handlers```

> Many device drivers have a similar general structure. A typical driver starts out by checking the input parameters to see if they are valid. If not, an error is re- turned. If they are valid, a translation from abstract to concrete terms may be need- ed. For a disk driver, this may mean converting a linear block number into the head, track, sector, and cylinder numbers for the diskâ€™s geometry.

5.3.2

#### Task 3

Which of the following are the typical functions of device-independent part of I/O software? Select all that apply

Select one or more:
- ```Uniform interfacing for device driving ```
- ```Error reporting on software level ```
- ```Allocating and releasing dedicated devices ```
- ```Interrupt handling```
- ```Data encryption```
